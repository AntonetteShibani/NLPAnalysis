        "Itâ€™s important to recognise that whilst AI tools enable us to do some amazing things, they have their limitations. Unlike search engines that provide you with options that match your query, ChatGPT gives you a definitive answer that may limit your own research abilities. Google has already entered this space, and there will be more to follow including the integration of GPT-3 in everyday tools such as Microsoft Teams. \n",
        "ChatGPT is a language model, not a knowledge base. \n",
        "One way to think about it is that it is a very sophisticated autocorrect. It has the capacity to generate text by anticipating what words should follow, creating cohesive and confident sounding sentences. However, it does not (and can not) validate the accuracy of the information it provides. These confident, but incorrect statements have been termed â€˜hallucinations. In more problematic instances, it has even been shown to gaslight users. This subject requires you to do your own research towards topics of your interest, and ensure that information provided is correct.\n",
        "ChatGPT canâ€™t recognise its sources. \n",
        "This means it canâ€™t reference where the information is coming from. It has also been shown to make up false references and citations that do not exist in order to sound correct. As a language model, its objective is to present plausible sentences, not accurate information. This subject requires you to reference your research to ensure your understanding is founded on credible information.\n",
        "Limited data.\n",
        "ChatGPT has only been trained on data up until 2021. This means it does not have access to any up to date information, nor can it access new information as it is not connected to the internet. Whilst some argue that AI presents a paradigm shift for new creative outputs (WIRED), others argue that the limitations of AI data is a dangerous constraint on human imagination (Horning, 2022). This subject requires you to research and explore up to date trends and emerging signals, as well as challenging you to push your creativity.\n",
        "AI data has inherent (and often problematic) biases.\n",
        "An ongoing issue in the creation and implementation of AI tools is the inherent biases from training data. The reflection and reproduction of assumptions and biases has led to highly problematic results, like racist and sexist claims. This subject requires you to examine personal biases and critically reflect upon values in the futures you propose.\n",
        "Generative AI tools might have violated privacy laws.\n",
        "Large language models in GPT-3 and similar tools have obtained data from the web for training purposes, not all of which are openly available for public use. Itâ€™s been called a â€˜privacy nightmareâ€™ as the tool has over 300 billion words scraped from the internet: books, articles, websites and posts â€“ including personal information obtained without consent. Other generative AI tools that generate images have also been under scrutiny as they face lawsuits for using Copyrighted works of art.\n",
        "ChatGPT is a proprietary tool\n",
        "ChatGPT is owned by OpenAI, which has control of the tool and your user data. The source code and the underlying models are not open sourced, meaning we do not know how the model actually works. The openly available version is a free research preview which does not guarantee access (You may need to pay for this in the future). Alternate open source models and tools are currently being developed - you may contribute to them!\n",
